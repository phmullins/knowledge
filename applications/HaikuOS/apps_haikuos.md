## HaikuOS Applications

HaikuOS is an open-source clone of BeOS and is (at the moment) binary compatible with old BeOS apps. I try to use Haiku apps whenever possible as they're optimized for the system. However, a few older BeOS apps might have managed to sneak their way in. This is an extensive list of applications that I have installed and use either on a daily basis or semi-regularly.
