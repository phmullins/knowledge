## Vintage Computers

I was one of the lucky few who grew up during the late 1970s, mid 1980s, and early 1990s and had access to several of these systems. This time is widely considered to be the golden age of personal computers. During this timeframe we saw the introduction of the Commodore line (VIC-20, C64, C128, Amiga), the Apple line (II, II Plus, IIe, Macintosh, Macintosh Plus, Macintosh SE), and the Atari line (400, 800, XE, ST, TT) of personal computers. This was the era of the Motorola 68000 line of processors, a series of CPUs that dominated the PC world until the arrival of cheaper Intel/AMD chips in the early nineties.

I was lucky enough to own a VIC-20, [Amiga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga) 500, Amiga 1000, and an Amiga 1200. Currently I own several broken C64s and a rare Commodore 64C. 

## Apple
