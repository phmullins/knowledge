## Windows/PC

I'm a long time PC gamer having started way back in 1992 when I sold my Amiga 500 and bought a new Packard Bell 386. Some of the 
first few games that I played on the platform were Rise of The Dragon, Overlord (Supremacy), Wolfenstein 3D, Spear of Destiny, 
System Shock, Ultima, and Doom. I stuck with PC games until 2005. I eventually switched to the Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, and now
macOS. However, I still maintain a Windows 10 Pro bootcamp partiton on my MacBook Pro for those games that are only available on
the PC.
