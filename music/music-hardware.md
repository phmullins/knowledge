This is where I get all kinds of crazy talking about the audio devices that I own or wish that I owned. lol. Headphones, Amps, Dacs, speakers, turntables, etc. If it plays, converts, amplifies, or allows me to listen to music then it's listed here. 

#### Over-Ear Headphones (Own)

You just can't beat the sound that a good pair of over-ear headphones can give you.

#### Headphone AMPS/DACS (Own)

Pretty much any decent headphone is going to require and AMP/DAC. Yes, even 32 ohm cans will perform better with a good portable/desktop AMP.

- [FiiO E10](https://amzn.to/2E79SEO)
- Schiit Fulla (1st Gen)

I'm happy to say that I managed to score a matched pair of 1960s Mullard 6AK5 tubes on eBay. The stock Chinese tubes that came with my HIFIMAN EF2A headphone amp are terribly harsh on the old ears. There's no bass to speak of, a middling midrange, and bright, ear splitting highs. They're probably the worst sounding tubes that I've ever heard and they needed to be swapped out immediately. The British-made Mullards (especially the vintage variety) are widely considered to be the Cadillacs of the vacuum tube world. They produce a heavenly sound that contains plenty of tight, controlled bass, a smooth, focused midrange, and crystal clear, non-fatiguing highs. The only real drawbacks to these tubes are the associated shipping costs and actually being able to track down a matched pair. The United Kingdom seems to be the only country that still has a readily available supply of vintage Mullard tubes and, as you might imagine, the shipping costs to the United States are completely insane. Still, all things considered, the sublime sound that these tubes produce is well worth the overall monetary costs and the agonizingly long trip across the pond.

#### Home Office

In my home office I have a set of [Paradigm 7SE](https://www.paradigm.com/products-hidden/model=performance-3se/page=specs) monitors and a Harmon-Kardon (HK3490) receiver. Yes, those are some big speakers, but damn they sound good! The 7SE is a 2 way rear ported system with a Vifa tweeter and Paradigms own 8" woofer with long lasting rubber surrounds. 

- CD Transport: Sony
- Turntable: Akai Professional BT100

#### Home Theater

Sad to say but the home theater has fallen by the wayside of late. There was a time when I wouldn't watch a movie unless it was DTS encoded and made use of the 5.1 surround system that I had. These days? I installed a Bose Solo 5 sound bar above the Sony 4K set and haven't looked back. This means I have a few pieces of gear not being used. Most notably, the Rotel RSX-1055. 

- Receiver: Rotel RSX-1055 5.1 (6.1, 7.1 capable).
- Speakers: Polk Towers
- Sub Woofer: Polk PSW108 10‚Äù
- Television: 65" Sony XBR65X750D 4K HDR
- DVD/Blu-Ray: Sony UBP-X800
- Remote: Caavo
- Misc: Bose SOLO 5
