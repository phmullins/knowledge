## Poem - Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night

by Dylan Thomas, 1914 - 1953<br>

Do not go gentle into that good night,<br> Old age should burn and rave at close of day;<br> Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br><br>  Though wise men at their end know dark is right,<br> Because their words had forked no lightning they<br> Do not go gentle into that good night.<br><br>  Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright<br> Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,<br> Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br><br>  Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,<br> And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,<br> Do not go gentle into that good night.<br><br>  Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight<br> Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,<br> Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
